# java-213-day-coding-marathon-class10

Welcome to my **Class 10 Java Exploration** repository—where I built more advanced programs to deepen my understanding of Java and OOP concepts.

##  What I Learned This Year

In Class 10, I progressed from basic programming to more sophisticated Java constructs and techniques, including:

-  **User-Defined Methods**  
  - Organized code using reusable methods  
  - Applied method overloading and recursion

-  **Constructors**  
  - Learned the difference between constructors and methods  
  - Used constructors to initialize object states

-  **Library (Wrapper) Classes**  
  - Used `Integer`, `Character`, etc., with autoboxing and unboxing

-  **Encapsulation**  
  - Practiced data hiding using access specifiers

-  **Arrays & String Handling**  
  - Worked with 1D/2D arrays  
  - Implemented searching (Linear/Binary) and sorting (Bubble/Selection)  
  - Manipulated strings using `String` and `StringBuffer`

##  Why It Matters

These projects marked my growth from writing simple scripts to building structured, object-oriented Java programs. Working with constructors, recursion, and advanced data operations deepened my problem-solving mindset—and equipped me for real-world programming and AI foundations.
